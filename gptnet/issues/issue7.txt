# Issue #7: Load Hugging Face Safetensors in C#
**Assignee:** Systems Agent

## Description
Use `PyBridge` to load the `.safetensors` parameters. You must map the Python keys (e.g., `transformer.h.0`) to your local C# module keys.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Weights are successfully loaded without "Missing Key" or "Unexpected Key" errors.
- [ ] Loaded weights are placed on the correct device (GPU/CUDA).
- [ ] Verification that `nn.Embedding` and `nn.Linear` layers receive correct pre-trained values.

## Required Code Structure
```csharp
using TorchSharp.PyBridge; //

public void LoadModelWeights(GPT2Model model, string path) {
    // Standard PyTorch key mapping logic
    model.load_safetensors(path); 
    Console.WriteLine("Weights successfully loaded via CUDA API bridge.");
}
